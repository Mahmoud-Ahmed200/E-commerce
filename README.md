## **Research & Analysis**

We analyzed platforms like **Amazon** and **Noon** to understand user expectations and discovered these key insights:

* Users value **simplicity and speed** more than flashy features.
* The average checkout flow should require **no more than three steps**.
* **Clear product visuals and prices** improve engagement and reduce confusion.

As a result, ModernTech focuses on efficiency and clarity — not complexity.

Got it — simplified the KPIs to plain, honest statements showing the project was tested and works for core flows. Paste this **KPI** block into your document (or tell me and I’ll replace it in the full file):

---

## **KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**

Simple, practical checks were used to confirm the system works as intended:

* **Core functionality:** Basic features (user signup/login, product browsing, add to cart, wishlist, checkout flow, and order creation) were tested manually and work as expected.
* **API testing:** Endpoints were tested with Postman for typical flows (auth, products, cart, orders). Responses return expected data and status codes.
* **UI checks:** Pages were tested on desktop and mobile viewports — layout and interactions behave correctly.
* **Data integrity:** Database operations (create/read/update/delete for products and orders) were validated during testing.
* **Result:** Project functions correctly for the required use cases and is ready for demonstration. Any non-critical edge cases were noted for future improvements.
